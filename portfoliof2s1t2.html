          <blockquote class="blockquote">“Music exists in time; architecture, instead, does exist in space. Dance lives altogether in space and time.” Curt Sachs_</blockquote>

          <p>Zona Martiska consists of an immersive performance in which all participants share the intimacy of a collective urban exploration. Freely inspired by "Stalker" of A.Tarkovskij, the performance guides the audience through unexplored and abandoned architectural pieces. Thanks to a robot and sensors on the dancers' body, the result is a unique and site-specific performance.</p>

          <span class="meta blue">4 minutes read</span>
          <img class="img-fluid margin" src="img/d11.jpg" alt="">

          <h2 class="section-heading blue">how it started</h2>


          <p>The beginning of the journey was quite unexpected: <span class="meta blue">six friends with different backgrounds</span> - from design to composing music - teamed up to participate in a public <span class="meta blue">call of Compagnia di San Paolo</span>. The aim of the scholarship was to <span class="meta blue">support artistic production</span> of a concept coming from a team of under-30 kids. Suprise, we won the prize and got to work!

          </p><p>All in all we knew where we wanted to go: <span class="meta blue">merging architecture with dance, through the use of technology</span>. And that is what we started to research, opening a call for three dancers and a choreographer.</p>

            <div class="text-center">
            <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/d2.JPG" alt="">
            </div>

          <p>We quickly identified two components. On the one hand, we wanted a sort of an <span class="meta blue">interactive robot to scan the space</span>, measuring distances and turning them into a soundscape that interacts with the moving audience. On the other hand, performers were to be equipped with <span class="meta blue">body sensors</span> that translate their movement into sound modulations.</p>

          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/d4.jpg" alt="">
          </div>

          <h2 class="section-heading blue">reharsing and researching</h2>
          <p>After putting together the team, we launched three residence programs in which we investigated both <span class="meta blue">the technological and the coreographical aspects</span> of the soon-to-be performance. Performers were equipped with a <span class="meta blue">Nintendo Wii</span> - a very precise and easy to hack IMU sensor, which could talk to Max Msp via a software called Osculator. </p>

<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/d3.jpg" alt="">

</div>
<p>So how did it work? Each one of the performer could <span class="meta blue">generate and modulate</span> a specific musical instrument, according to the <span class="meta blue">position of her arm</span> - <span class="meta blue">rotation, pitch and accelleration</span> were the key parameters.</p>
          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/d5.jpg" alt="">
          </div>
          <p>At the same time, Martino - <span class="meta blue">the cute scanning robot</span> - came to life and started to detect presence of walls, obstacles and people while rotating on its body. The distance detected would be transformed into a <span class="meta blue">sound modulation</scan>.</p>
                    <div class="text-center">
                    <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/d7.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>Martino got then upgraded to a real <span class="meta blue">PLA body</span>, which gave him a total italian classy look.</p>
                              <div class="text-center">
                              <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/d6.jpg" alt="">
                              </div>

                              <p>Parallel to that, we also kept on investigating what was the other core part of the performance: architecture. We were looking for <span class="meta blue">abandoned places</span> and were keen on using <span class="meta blue">our performance as an excuse</span> to bring in audience to places which are not accessible. Luckily, the region of Piedmont opened for us the door of the <span class="meta blue">greenhouse at Parco La Mandria</span> -abandoned since 1998 - right in the outskirt of Turin.</p>
                                        <div class="text-center">
                                        <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/d7.jpg" alt="">
                                        </div>
                    <p>Needless to say, we were happy as kids in front of such a <span class="meta blue">pristine and desolated landscape</span> - it was the right venue for our performance.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading blue">3-2-1 live!</h2>
                    <p>So it happened, on a three days palimpsest we launced six shows of about fifty minutes. At each time, only 50 visitors were allowed, cause we wanted it to be an  <span class="meta blue">intimate experience</span>.</p>

                    <div class="text-center">
                    <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/d9.jpg" alt="">
                       <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/d8.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>Martino the robot scanner also got <span class="meta blue">quite an upgrade</span>: it is now equipped with a 40m range sensor and a laser scanner which shows the direction of the sensing unit.</p>


                        <div class="text-center">


                    <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/d10.jpg" alt="">
                      </div>
                    <p>The video below shows an extract from the performance, <span class="meta blue">enjoy it</span>!</p>

    <div class="text-center">

<p>To conclude we received plenty of <span class="meta blue">positive reactions</span>. However, as expected, several people found the interaction too difficult to be understood - surely something to work on for the <span class="meta blue">next performances</span>!</p>


                    <p>That's how we created a <span class="meta blue">Zona Martiska</span>, an interactive performance in Turin, Italy.</p>
