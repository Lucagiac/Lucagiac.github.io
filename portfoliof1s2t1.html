          <p>“The Circular Garden,” is a temporary installation that was grown from soil over six weeks time – and was returned to the soil at the end of Milan Design Week edition of 2019. It is composed of a series of arches in which mycelium - that is the root fiber of the fungus - was used as a building material.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading blue">Milan's Fuorisalone 2019</h2>


          <p>Commissioned by multinational energy company ENI, the project represented a chance for us designers to question the topic of <span class="meta blue">"fast" design</span>. Our team was challenged to find a way to give architecture a <span class="meta blue">circular approach</span>, where materials and fabrication choices could lead to a <span class="meta blue">"reusable" or "recyclable" or "compostable" pavilion</span>.</p>

          <p>Mycelium - that is the fibrous root of the mushroom - after weeks of research became the main construction material of the temporary pavilion. <span class="meta blue">From soil (mushroom) to soil (compost)</span>.

                  </div>

          <p>Architecture was a non-invasive intervention inside a special venue: the botanical garden of Brera: <span class="meta blue">lines of pavilions are simply evoked with 64 arches that are 4 meters tall.</span> In the context, visitors could walk through the whole garden and could get under the arches.</p>

          <p>The final touch of the material is <span class="meta blue">rough</span>, very eterogeneous and that well blended in the context.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading blue">how did we get there?</h2>

          <p>

          <p>When we started researching innovative materials, we fell in love with the idea that <span class="meta blue">mycelium - the fibrous part of the fungus</span> could actually grow inside a botanical garden, hence giving a perfect story to tell: <span class="meta blue">from soil (mushroom) to soil (compost)</span>. How could the fibrous root of a fungus grow? It needs specific temperature, specific humidity levels and of course something organic to chew, such as hay or hemp. </p>

          <p><span class="meta blue">How can it become a material for construction then?</span> If the growht is confined within specific moulds, the fungus root becomes a sort of a hardener for the organic substrate.</p>

          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/a6.JPG" alt="">
          </div>

          <p>The first tests showed that the material was performing well under compression and after a long form-finding process we ended up liking the idea of an <span class="meta blue">inverted catenary</span> as a shape. Inspired by the works of Gaudi - above all the corridor of the Collegi de Les Teresianes - we started to create some physical mockups of an <span class="meta blue">open sky cathedral</span>, as it was becoming to being.</p>
          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/a13.JPG" alt="">
          </div>



          <p>Construction begun as we teamed up with expert <span class="meta blue">bio-fabricator and mycologists</span> in the Netherlands. We started to go in and out from Den Bosh, a small village in the Dutch countryside, where production took place. After 6 weeks, we got the keys to the botanical garden, ready to go and install!</p>

          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/a14.jpg" alt="">

          </div>


                    <p>So, what happened to it in the end? Of course we were not allowed to compost the arches inside the garden, due to restriction from the municipality. The good news came when a farm in the outskirt of Milan offered to come and pick up the 64 arches. Deal.</p>

                    <p>That's how we managed to create a pavilion <span class="meta blue">from the soil - to the soil</span>.</p>
