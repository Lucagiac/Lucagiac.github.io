          <blockquote class="blockquote">“The city is an open canvas, where people can inscribe their stories in many ways. Such processes have always been happening.” Carlo Ratti_</blockquote>

          <p>"Paint by Drone" is the world’s first crowdsourced graffiti, designed by thousands of people on a collaborative web interface and painted by a swarm of drones in the city of Torino, Italy. The final vertical graffiti was created by four drones flying simultaneously over two consecutive days. Each drone carried a tank of spray paint and sketched the individual designs on the canvas.

          <img class="img-fluid margin" src="img/e1.JPG" alt="">

          <p>How can we give a large crowd the <span class="meta blue">chance to collaborate</span> on producing an artwork? And then, how can we make a wise use of technology in order to reproduce such a drawing onto <span class="meta blue">an urban landscape</span>? These very questions were at the basis of the concept - as show in the schematic below.</p>
          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/e2.JPG" alt="">
          </div>

          <h2 class="section-heading blue">from a collaborative drawing...</h2>


          <p>In order to collect contribution from a vast audience, we launched for two months a <span class="meta blue">web-app</span> in which users from all over the world could draw <span class="meta blue">using few rules</span>. In the first place, the interface was very basic: you could <span class="meta blue">draw a line</span> with fingers or mouse track and you could <span class="meta blue">swap between four different colours</span>.</p>
          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/e3.JPG" alt="">
          </div>

          <p>We based the app on a <span class="meta blue">true life metaphor</span>: digital canvas size was respecting the real dimensions of 12x15 meters, hence each user could draw with a digital spray can for about 10 meters only. So we asked the audience to respond to a simple question: <span class="meta blue">the city is an open canvas - what is the city for you</span>? </br>Needless to say, first results were a bit cahotic.</p>
          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/e5.JPG" alt="">
          </div>

          <p>As an invisible hand over the crowdsourcing process, <span class="meta blue">we acted as a curator</span>, using a backend app which allowed us to <span class="meta blue">rate and evaluate each contribution</span> before it became public. That helped avoiding shameful content and gave us designers a chance to <span class="meta blue">orchestrate</span> the final output.</p>
          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/e4.JPG" alt="">

                  </div>

                  <p>And below the final result as it came to be: <span class="meta blue">few icons of the city of Turin</span> - including the outline of the Mole Antonelliana - and some more <span class="meta blue">random content</span>.</p>
                  <div class="text-center">
                  <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/e6.jpg" alt="">

                          </div>


          <h2 class="section-heading blue">... to a drone painter</h2>


          <p>The drone infrastructure looked relatively simple: we took the final drawing, broke it into segments that a drone could reproduce and we created <span class="meta blue">a palimpsest with "flight sessions"</span> - so to give drones time to <span class="meta blue">recharge battery</span> and <span class="meta blue">replace the spray can</span>.</p>
          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-12 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/e8.JPG" alt="">
          </div>

          <p>Each drone was equipped with a <span class="meta blue">300ml spray can</span> with was operated by a sort of a electro-mechanical handle. Besides that, each drone also carried a powerful <span class="meta blue">computing unit<span> for position tracing.</p>
          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/e9.jpg" alt="">
          </div>

          <p>In order to trace the position of the drone in <span class="meta blue">near real-time</span>, the canvas was equipped with 9 antennas and each drone carried a signal relay. The tech system, developed by Links Foundation, is called <span class="meta blue">UWB (ultra wide-band)</span>.</p>
          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/e10.jpg" alt="">
          </div>

          <p>And so from the lab we moved to the site to prepare for a <span class="meta blue">month full of testing</span>. It was a warm Italian summer...</p>
          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/e7.jpg" alt="">
          </div>

          <h2 class="section-heading blue">final graffiti</h2>
          <p><span class="meta blue">Parco Aurelio Peccei</span> is a former IVECO-FIAT factory, located in a multi-cultural neighbourhood on the outskirt of Turin. Choosing to showcase <span class="meta blue">technology and innovation at the perfiphery of the city</span> - hence avoiding Turin's majestic plazas - was surely a political choice.</p>

          <div class="text-center">
            <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/e12.jpg" alt="">
                  </div>


          <p>From a technical perspective some lines are quite messy, as wind turbolences obviously affected the final result. Still isn't it part of the <span class="meta blue">expressive qualities of the brush of the painter</span> - in this case the drone?</p>

          <div class="text-center">
            <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/e11.jpg" alt="">

                  </div>


                    <p>That's how we managed to take a <span class="meta blue">crowdsourced painting</span> and drawing it on a 200 square meter facade.</p>
