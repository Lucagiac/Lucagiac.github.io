          <p>“The Circular Garden,” is a temporary installation that was grown from soil over six weeks time – and was returned to the soil at the end of Milan Design Week edition of 2019. It is composed of a series of arches in which mycelium - that is the root fiber of the fungus - was used as a building material.</p>

          <span class="meta blue">3 minutes read</span>
          <img class="img-fluid margin" src="img/a1.jpg" alt="">

          <h2 class="section-heading blue">how it started</h2>


          <p>Commissioned by multinational energy company ENI, the project represented a chance for us designers to question the topic of <span class="meta blue">"fast" design</span>. Similarly to what we see happening for the fashion industry - Milan Design Week counts several temporary pavilions that become waste too soon after their showcase. Our team was challenged to find a way to give architecture a <span class="meta blue">circular approach</span>, where materials and fabrication choices could lead to a <span class="meta blue">"reusable" or "recyclable" or "compostable" pavilion</span>.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/a3.jpg" alt="">
          <p>
The scenario was surely a particular one. The <span class="meta blue">botanical garden of Brera</span> is a 300 years old garden in the hearth of Milan, within the historical artisan's design district of Brera. On the one hand it was a perfect and pristine setting, while on the other it also showed the difficulties of <span class="meta blue">working under strict regulations of the municipality</span> - being the garden protected as national heritage. As an example, we could not project large shadows onto the grass - needless to say hanging from the trees was forbidden!
          </p>
          <img class="img-fluid col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/a2.jpg" alt="">

          <h2 class="section-heading blue">researching</h2>

          <p>And so we started researching innovative materials, falling in love with the idea that <span class="meta blue">mycelium - the fibrous part of the fungus</span> could actually grow inside a botanical garden, hence giving a perfect story to tell: <span class="meta blue">from soil (mushroom) to soil (compost)</span>. How could the fibrous root of a fungus grow? It needs specific temperature, specific humidity levels and of course something organic to chew, such as hay or hemp. </p>

          <p><span class="meta blue">How can it become a material for construction then?</span> If the growht is confined within specific moulds, the fungus root becomes a sort of a hardener for the organic substrate.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/a5.jpg" alt="">

          <p>Hence we started to experiment ourselves, buying <span class="meta blue">Oyster Mushrooms</span> from Holland and making cheap moulds with sewerage pipings. Needless to say, first results were quite disappointing. </p>
          <img class="img-fluid col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/a6.jpg" alt="">


          <p>As the technical tests progressed, we also started to investigate how we could <span class="meta blue">shape</span> this construction material, trying to go beyond the concept of inventing mushrooms lego bricks - which had already been done anyways.</p>          <img class="img-fluid col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/a7.jpg" alt="">
          <p>The first tests showed that the material was performing well under compression and after a long form-finding process we ended up liking the idea of an <span class="meta blue">inverted catenary</span> as a shape. Inspired by the works of Gaudi - above all the corridor of the Collegi de Les Teresianes - we started to create some physical mockups of an <span class="meta blue">open sky cathedral</span>, as it was becoming to being.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/a8.jpg" alt="">

          <h2 class="section-heading blue">final result</h2>

          <p>Architecture was a non-invasive intervention on the beautiful botanical garden of Brera: <span class="meta blue">lines of pavilions are simply evoked with 64 arches that are 4 meters tall.</span> In the context, visitors could walk through the whole garden and could get under the arches.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/a9.jpg" alt="">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/a10.jpg" alt="">
          <p>The final touch of the material is <span class="meta blue">rough</span>, very eterogeneous and that well blended in the context.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/a11.jpg" alt="">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/a12.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>So, what happened to it in the end? Of course we were not allowed to compost the arches inside the garden, due to restriction from the municipality. The good news came when a farm in the outskirt of Milan offered to come and pick up the 64 arches. Deal.</p>

                    <p>That's how we managed to create a pavilion <span class="meta blue">from the soil - to the soil</span>.</p>
