          <blockquote class="blockquote">“What if we could create a streetscape that responds to citizens’ needs - hence changing dynamically?” Carlo Ratti_</blockquote>

          <p>The Dynamic Street, a prototype of a modular and reconfigurable paving system which hints at the possibility of the streetscape seamlessly adapting to people’s needs. In order to reconfigure the streetscape for multiple uses, the project explores the different patterns that can be created on the hexagonal grid as well as the integration of lights into individual pavers. </p>

          <span class="meta blue">4 minutes read</span>
          <img class="img-fluid margin" src="img/b1.jpg" alt="">

          <h2 class="section-heading blue">how it started</h2>


          <p>Commissioned by Alphabet's subsidiary Sidewalk Labs, the project represented a chance for experimenting with a <span class="meta blue">"living lab" at 307, Sidewalk Lab’s office and experimentation space in Toronto</span>. There, Sidewalk Labs is planning to deploy the ultimate smart city within the next few years, and we started with designing and building a full scale prototype of its streetscape.</p>

            <div class="text-center">
            <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/b4.jpg" alt="">
            </div>

          </p><p>Imagine an urban street, nestled between buildings with mostly foot and bicycle traffic. During the morning and evening hours, there might be a steady stream of commuters heading to work. In the middle of the day and the evening, families might use the street as a play space. And on the weekend, the street could be cleared for a block party or a basketball game.</p>

<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/b10.gif" alt="">

</div>
<p>The Dynamic Street features a series of <span class="meta blue">hexagonal modular pavers</span> which can be picked up and replaced, according to <span class="meta blue">the final use</span>. We created a taxonomy of different <span class="meta blue">materials and finishes</span> for such pavers, as shown below. Each one of the pavers comprehends <span class="meta blue">a metal plug with a built-in LED, a paver base and a paver topper</span>.</p>
          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/b2.JPG" alt="">
          </div>
          <p>On top of the paver, we also investigated how different <span class="meta blue">plug&play elements</span> could contribute to assigning new functions to the space.</p>
                    <div class="text-center">
                    <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-10 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/b3.JPG" alt="">
                    </div>
          <p>In the end, a combination of <span class="meta blue">physical cues</span> (the street furnitures and paver toppers) combined with the <span class="meta blue">built-in LEDS</span> would help users understand how the space was changing.


          <h2 class="section-heading blue">prototyping and manufacturing</h2>

          <p>The first mockups were very conceptual, still helping the team to develop and <span class="meta blue">finetune the concept</span>. It was then when it first occurred to us that we also had to consider <span class="meta blue">how to replace the paver topper</span>. Should it be a mechanical device which looks like a shopping kart? Should it be instead a fully autonomous scary robot?</p>

          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/b6.JPG" alt="">
          </div>

          <p>Hence we started to experiment ourselves - apart from rubber and wood, which materials did we want to explore? We had a lot of fun with <span class="meta blue">resins</span>!</p>

          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/b7.JPG" alt="">
            </div>






          <p>Engineering-wise, the <span class="meta blue">mechanical plug</span> was surely the most challenging aspect. It was meant <span class="meta blue">to be robust, to accommodate a LED and a street furniture piece</span> - such as a bollard.</p>

          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/b8.JPG" alt="">
          </div>

          <p>So quickly after testing on full scale mockups in Italy, the team moved to Toronto, where we started to construct the <span class="meta blue">full scale set-up</span>, enjoying the breeze coming from Lake Ontario.</p>
          <div class="text-center">

                      <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/b9.JPG" alt="">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/b16.JPG" alt="">

          </div>

          <h2 class="section-heading blue">final result</h2>

          <p>The project resulted in a vast true scale prototype of about <span class="meta blue">200 square meters</span>, where visitors could engage with Sidewalk Labs, with designers and eventually with the municipality in order to <span class="meta blue">collaboratively think</span> about the future of Toronto.</p>
          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/b11.jpg" alt="">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-8 mx-auto" src="img/b15.jpg" alt="">
                  </div>

          <p>How could users be involved in <span class="meta blue">re-shaping the streetscape</span>? On the one hand, visitors could engage with the paver-picking robot. On the other hand, everybody could load "new configurations" from a <span class="meta blue">tablet interface</span>. Users could <span class="meta blue">load several scenarios</span> (i.e. 1 car + 2 bikes lanes) or literally <span class="meta blue">draw live new proposals</span>. In that way, the feedback was of immediate understanding to most.</p>
          <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/b14.jpg" alt="">
          <img class="img-fluid margin col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto" src="img/b12.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
                    <p>The installation opened to the public for a series of events managed by Sidewalk Labs Toronto which aimed at engaging with the community of Toronto and dedbating about the topic of <span class="meta blue">smart cities and participatory design</span>.</p>

                    <p>That's how we created a <span class="meta blue">dynamically changing streetscape</span> in Toronto.</p>
