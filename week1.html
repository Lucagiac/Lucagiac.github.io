                    <h2 class="section-heading">Sherry Turkle-Together Alone</h2>

                    <p>In her book <a href"http://alonetogetherbook.com/">Alone Together</a>, Sherry Turkle writes about the relationship we have with technological devices, companion robots and social media. Extract of the first 4 chapters below.</p>
                    <blockquote>We are lonely but fearful of intimacy. Digital connection and sociable robots may offer the illusion of companionship without the demand of friendship".</i> I feel something in my stomach when I am not next to my phone and it seems like I am missing a limb when I am in a pub without my laptop stored in my backpack on my back. I would like to investigate further the very meaning of companionship with technological devices and the digital world in general.</blockquote>
                    <p>The fear of being judged is not present with a robotic companion. The value is in sharing an experience, not much in understanding/reflecting on what the robot is
                  </p>

                  <blockquote>... and so a dicothomy is constructed: physical vs pshychological</blockquote>
                  <p>Why does a ball roll down a slope? A kid would say because it wants (WILL), an adult would say because of gravity (SCIENCE)</p>

                  <blockquote>Furby is kind of real, but just a toy</blockquote>
                  <p>Kids can attribute two identities (biological and mechanical) at the same time and switch from the first to the second.</p>

                  <blockquote>If a robot simulates pain, it enables mistreatement</blockquote>

                  <blockquote>Without alterity there can not be empathy</blockquote>
                  <p>What are the implication given that we are really shaped by the technical devices that sourround us?</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Speculative Design</h2>

                    <p>I started to read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Speculative-Everything-Design-Fiction-Dreaming/0262019841">Speculative Everything</a> written by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby. According to the writer Bruce Sterling, design fiction is <i>"the deliberate use of diegetic prototypes to suspend disbelief about change"</i>. Design fiction aims at triggering debate and conversation about sensitive topics, in my case technology. The futurologist Stuart Candy maps out the future in the schematic below (image credit: http://corcoranfordesign.com).

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/week1/3.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>The first relevant project I run into is the "Technological Dream Series" by Dunne and Raby. They designed a set of robotic companions to trigger debate around how we would like our robots to relate to us in the future. Cool aesthetics.

                    <p>The second relevant project is the "Carnivorous Domestic Entertainment Robot" by J.Auger, that investigates a scenario in which a robot can be self-sustaining from an energy point of view.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Prototype of the Caress Machine</h2>

                    <p>The video below shows the first prototype that I built.<br>
. is it necessary? Meaning, do you really feel so lonely that you need a machine to caress your hand?<br>
. the more you stroke it, the more intense it actually caresses you back. Might that lead to excitement or could it go opposite towards frustration? </p>

                    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/206462475?portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>


                  <h2 class="section-heading">Two Ideas</h2>

                  <p>I would like to build two robotic machines to further explore this area. The first one would be an evolution of the caress machine and would actually stroke properly.
                  </p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/week1/1.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="">
                    <p>The second machine would be a blowing machine. In this, I am interested in developing an aesthetic for it.</p>
