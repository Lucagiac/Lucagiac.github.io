                    <p><i><b>Preface</b><br>
                      The full work presented in this page has been developed by myself, Nakia Hao and Keisuke Akyiama, whom I am really greatful to. Full documentation on that 3-weeks period can be found on <a href="https://nklthesis.github.io">NKL Blog</a>. In the first part we investigated the role of phylosophy and religion in the perception of natural elements and the human body. We really focussed on why eastern and western cultures at large produced artworks and devices that differ so much. I then started to look at companion robotics, animism, phenomenology and I tried to make sense of all that. Needless to say how bad I failed.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Japanese vs Euro-American Robotics</h2>

                    <p>We visited the Robot exhibit at the science museum and that made us reflect on why Japanese robotics is so different from let's say European/American robotics. Below are two of the most impressive: Kodomoroid and Asimo. They are meant to be assistive/companion robots and they are in all the aspects human-like, or at least that is what the engineers had in mind.

                      <p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/421187/why-japanese-love-robots-and-americans-fear-them/">This Article</a> helped us better understanding the differences of the two cultures and how they emerge in the way robots are designed. On Japanese culture Naho Kitano says:</p>
                        <blockquote>The sun, the moon, mountains and trees each have their own spirits, or gods. Each god is given a name, has characteristics, and is believed to have control over natural and human phenomena. This thought has continued to be believed and influences the Japanese relationship with nature and spiritual existence. This belief later expanded to include artificial objects, so that spirits are thought to exist in all the articles and utensils of daily use, and it is believed that these sprits of daily-use tools are in harmony with human beings.
                        </blockquote><p>
                        On America Culture Rui Umezawa says:</p>
      <blockquote>
                        In order to understand fully religion’s influence on the West’s attitude toward robotics, we also must remember that Judeo-Christian monotheism also adheres to the doctrine that only God can give life, a popular interpretation of Genesis in which there is only God in the beginning and all living things are His creations. Exodus also decrees that idolatry is a sin. Thus, any human who breathes life into an inanimate object is assuming the role of God and thereby becoming a false idol. Such a blasphemer deserves punishment, and in the conventions of science fiction, this usually comes in the form of betrayal by the robots. From the 1920 work R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots) by Czech playwright Karel Čapek - who is credited with coining the term “robot” – through The Terminator movies to Battlestar Galactica, such human vanity is constantly met by rebellion by its creation.
                    </blockquote>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Interaction Explorations</h2>
      <p>Doing interaction studies without a context proved to be quite fun for nerds, yeah. All in all, we tried to put together a very simple scenario. We aimed at a neutral object of neutral shape. The closest we could get to such an ideal situation was a pair of trivial sticks. In the scenario, one stick is an actuator and one is a sensor. Two behaviors were designed, thinking of the ideas of animism and OOO. The underlying questions of these exploration where:<br>
      . can the behavior of an object manifest the fact that the object has a spirit, or an inner form of identity, at large?<br>
      . is that even relevant, meaning, how would the perception of an object change to me if I knew it has a soul?<br>
    Ovbiosly the two scenario that where investigated are quite speculative and, to some extent, ridicolous.
    </p>
    <h5>Curious/Playful behaviour</h5>
    <p>What if any object could be animated through some actuator and be able to communicate with you when it wants to interact, much like a pet-owner relationship? In this scenario, the stick on the left calls for attention and then follows the position of the stick on the right, once it is touched by a third object, a human.</p>
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/205533080" frameborder="0" width="640" height="360" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <h5>Angry/Protective behaviour</h5>
    <p>Starting from an anecdote, few nights back Luca squeezed a soda can in front of Nakia and K. Nakia shivered and K admitted it hurted somehow, while Luca just thought he did squeeze a piece of aluminum, nothing more. Do object perceive pain? In this scenario, when the stick on the right is perturbated and mistreated by the object-human, the stick on the left jumps onto the stage in order to defend its mate.</p>
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/205534571" frameborder="0" width="640" height="360" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusions</h2>
      <p>The experiment of the two sticks was fun and somehow interesting. Thinking now more of a network of devices, a set of machines that can perform very basic interactions.</p>
