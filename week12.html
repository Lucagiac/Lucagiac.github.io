                    <p><i><b>Summary of the week</b><br>Main work of the last few days consisted of trying to make sense of my design process and making an attempt of synthesis.</i></p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">From studies of behaviour</h2><br><b>Focus: the object</b></p>

                        <p>In the first part of the year I was much interested in the theme of companionship with robots and electronic devices at large. In her book <a href"http://alonetogetherbook.com/">Alone Together</a>, Sherry Turkle writes about it like follows:</p>
                        <blockquote>We are lonely but fearful of intimacy. Digital connection and sociable robots may offer the illusion of companionship without the demand of friendship".</i> I feel something in my stomach when I am not next to my phone and it seems like I am missing a limb when I am in a pub without my laptop stored in my backpack on my back. I would like to investigate further the very meaning of companionship with technological devices and the digital world in general.</blockquote>

                        <p>
                        In all that, it seemed to me that the focus of my research should have been put on the <i>behaviour</b> of these electronic companions, as a sine qua non condition for engagement with humans. From that, I build four prototypes where I tried to subvert a paradigm. Instead of building "a robot that caresses you" where clearly the focus is about the <i>interaction</i> with it, I named them with their particular associated attitude.</br>

                        .1 A caring robot: a study on pain and shared empathy;</br>
                    .2 An intimate robot: a study on intimacy;</br>
                    .3 A silly robot: a study on unpredictable and irreverent behaviour;</br>
                    .4 A tamed robot: a study on obedience and servile attitude;

                            <p>Moving further from the independent interaction studies towards the possible applications with a UR-10 robotic arm, I got inspired by puppetry. I built a reproduction of a robotic arm that could let me explore:<br>
    -movement through a set of poses of the robotic arm;<br>
    -interactivity with a set of end effectors.</p>

              <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/209357319?portrait=0" width=100% height="420" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

              <p>For some unknown reason I was not satisfied with these explorations, as I thought that behaviour alone was weak. I felt the need of designing controllers that were more direct and precise, therefore switching the focus of the project from the objects to the user.</p></i>

              <h2 class="section-heading">To studies of direct control</h2><br><b>Focus: the user</b></p>

              <p>The second part of my research involved designing and testing a set of direct controllers. Inspired by science-fiction characters, the interface allows for a direct manipulation of a UR10 robotic arm. Looking back at the initial theme of companionship, it can be argued that here it is put equal to human mastery over technology. </p>

    <h2 class="section-heading">A difficult match</h2>

                                                <p>What is being difficult at this moment is to reconceliate the two sides of the project. On the one hand, can companionship only be fueled by nature-like behaviour, sacrificing a bit of human control for the sake of expressivity? On the other hand, can we call companionship a form of direct control?<br>
                                                  It is quite clear to me that the second part of my project led me to a bit of a dreadlock, while the first part was far more stimulating.
                                                </p>
                                                <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusions</h2>

                                                                                            <p>I am most likely taking a step back from the controller/interface section. I am not even sure that the UR10 is really the way to go. I wouldnt have used blue foam, but I wish Nicole's <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/06/22/central-saint-martins-graduate-misbehaving-robots-technology-design/">project</a> was mine.
